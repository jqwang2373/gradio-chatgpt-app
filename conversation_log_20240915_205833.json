        "model_1_response": "The correct answer is 'B. To control the throttle response time'. The 'driver.SetThrottleDelta()' method is used to adjust how quickly the throttle can respond to changes, which affects the vehicle's acceleration behavior.",
        "model_2_response": "The purpose of the `driver.SetThrottleDelta()` method is typically **B. To control the throttle response time**. This method is used to adjust how quickly the throttle responds to input, allowing for finer control over acceleration in a driving simulation or game."

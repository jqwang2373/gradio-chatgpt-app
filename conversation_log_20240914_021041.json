The initial position and orientation are defined, placing the vehicle slightly above the ground to start the simulation. The visualization type for the vehicle parts (mesh-based) and collision model (no collision) are also set.\\n\\n2. **Terrain Setup**: The terrain is created as a rigid surface using the `RigidTerrain` class. It is given a texture and defined as a flat area of 100x100 meters. The friction and restitution values are set to simulate realistic interactions between the vehicle's tires and the terrain.\\n\\n3. **FEDA Vehicle Setup**: The FEDA vehicle is initialized with a TMEASY tire model, which is ideal for simulating tire dynamics. The simulation step size for both the vehicle and tires is set, ensuring the dynamics are accurately calculated at each time step.\\n\\n4. **Visualization System**: The Irrlicht-based visualization system is used to render the simulation. A chase camera is attached to track the vehicle from a third-person perspective, ensuring smooth visualization as the vehicle moves. Additional elements, such as lighting and a skybox, enhance the visual realism of the scene.\\n\\n5. **Driver System**: An interactive driver system is created, allowing the user to control the vehicle via keyboard inputs for steering, throttle, and braking. The response times for each input are set, defining how quickly the vehicle reacts to steering or throttle changes.\\n\\n6. **Simulation Loop**: The simulation runs continuously in a loop while the visualization system is active. The driver inputs are captured and synchronized with the vehicle and terrain. The system advances by one time step (defined by `step_size`), updating the dynamics and rendering the scene in real-time. The simulation ensures smooth transitions between frames using a real-time step timer.\\n\\n7. **Real-time Interaction**: The simulation dynamically adjusts based on the driver's inputs, allowing for real-time interaction with the FEDA vehicle. The output also includes the vehicle's mass for reference, which is printed to the console during the simulation."

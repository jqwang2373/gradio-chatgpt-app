        "model_1_response": "Chrono::Engine is a physics-based simulation framework designed for real-time simulations of 3D environments. It supports complex interactions between objects, terrain, and vehicles, making it ideal for simulations that require accurate physics calculations. You can create and manipulate 3D objects, define their physical properties, and simulate their interactions with other objects and the environment. For instance, you can model a vehicle driving on terrain and observe its dynamics in real-time. Chrono::Engine also allows for the integration of sensors and other technologies, enhancing the realism and utility of the simulation.",
